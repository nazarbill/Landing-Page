# MediMask: Safeguarding Health Information with Performance in Mind

## Project Description
My Project is a comprehensive study on the impact of data masking on the performance of healthcare databases, which emphasises the balance between maintaining patient data privacy and ensuring that the database operates efficiently. As healthcare services become more and more digitalized, causing the risk of data breaches to increase, it highlights the need for effective data protection using strategies like data masking. My Research project focuses on implementing dynamic data masking (DMM) using MongoDB, assessing and comparing how using different Data Masking techniques in MongoDB affect database performance. By generating synthetic healthcare data through Mockaroo, creating a dummy website to browse the healthcare database as different users with different permissions (e.g. doctor and receptionist), and using performance metrics like browser developer tools to assess the impact of data masking on query response times, my project aims to illustrate if MongoDB can achieve safeguarding patient information without significantly hindering the functionality of healthcare databases.
